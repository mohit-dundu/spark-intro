We will go over the basics of Apache Spark and PySpark. We will start with creating the SparkContext and SparkSession. We then create an RDD and apply some basic transformations and actions. Finally, we demonstrate the basic dataframes and SparkSQL.

The outcome is listed as follows:

* Create the SparkContext and SparkSession
* Create an RDD and apply some basic transformations and actions to RDDs
* Demonstrate the use of the basic Dataframes and SparkSQL
